								<p>
									<i>Python, OpenCV, Node.js, Javascript, Express, HTML</i> <br><br>
									Passport Photo Generator is a locally hosted website which converts inputted images into passport photos satisfying U.S. passport requirements. 
									It utilizes OpenCV for face detection, image rotation, centering and alignment, 
									and the U<sup>2</sup>-net deep learning architecture for salient object detection for background removal.
									The above image was generated using the program!

								<p>
									<i>Node.js, discord.js, JavaScript</i> <br><br>
									Waitlist-Bot is a discord bot that assists with the course waitlist process at UIUC.
									It takes into account that most students intend to drop a course they're currently in if a seat opens up in their desired course,
									and then utilizes this knowledge to construct a directed multigraph where each edge connects a student's target course to the course they're willing to drop. 
									It then uses a DFS to detect cycles and notify all involved users once found, enabling them to all register for their desired courses.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/anshgs/SOFT036T" class="icon brands fa-github"> ISEF SOFT036 - Improved Quantum Cryptography </a>   </h3>
								<p><i>Python, Qiskit, MatPlotLib, IBM Q </i> <br> <br>
								
									SOFT036 was a research project done by myself and Rohan Kulkarni(Columbia '25) for the 2021 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.
									Our project centered on designing and implementing an improvement to the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol,
									specifically targeting its inefficient retention rate through the use of quantum entangled systems 
									and improving its security by devising a quantum digital signature scheme to verify the sender's identity without leaking information to an eavesdropper.

								<h3><a href="M3_Challenge_2021.pdf" class="icon regular fa-file-alt"> Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge</a></h3>
								<p><i>Python, C++</i> <br> <br>
									
									The M3 Challenge is a math modeling competition where teams of 6 are tasked to 
									collect data, design models, and write a paper to solve various tasks.
									The 2021 competition centered around combatting the "digital divide", with questions on
									predicting the cost of the internet over the next decade, predicting the needed bandwidth to support a household given 
									information on its inhabitants, and optimizing the distribution of 5G across a hypothetical region. 
									Our team's paper placed within the top 100 out of nearly 600 submission.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/anshgs/Fandead" class="icon brands fa-github"> 2021 MIT Battlecode </a> </h3>
								<p>
									<i>Java </i> <br> <br>
									Battlecode is a real-time strategy game where teams of up to four code an AI player. 
									The AI player needs to manage a robot army and control their behaviors individually and as a collective 
									with limited communication and computational abilities in order to defeat the enemy player. Our bot utilized 
									pathfinding, distributed algorithms, communications, and other strategies to remain competitive.
									We placed 22nd out of over 550  total teams(high school and college), and 4th out of 52 teams in the H.S. division.
